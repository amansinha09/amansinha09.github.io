## About Me


I am a PhD student at Universit√© de Lorraine, Nancy, France, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marianneclausel/home?authuser=0">Marianne Clausel</a>, <a href="https://perso.atilf.fr/mconstant/">Mathieu Constant</a> and <a href="https://xavieratcern.github.io/index.html">Xavier Coubez</a>. My research involves exploring the structure of data in medical domain to enhance Natural Language Processing based models. Most recently, I'm interested in 1) exploiting temporal characterstics of medical data to create better outcome prediction models, and 2) integrating knowledge graphs to complement medical decision support systems.
