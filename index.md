## About Me

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Dan Weld</a>. My research tends to involve ideas from both Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing. Most recently, I'm interested in 1) how explanations influence AI-advised decision making, and 2) AI applications for interactive document exploration.

I collaborate frequently with the Semantic Scholar team at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), and have previously interned with Google Research working on mobile accessibility and modeling mobile interaction. For Summer 2023, I will be interning at Adobe Research on the Document Intelligence team, investigating user-centered multi-document exploration with large language models.

## Research Interests

- **Human-Computer Interaction** XAI for decision-making, interactive systems to support scholars
- **Natural Language Processing:** long-form document understanding, science QA, LLMs for science writing
